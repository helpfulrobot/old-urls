silverstripe-old-urls
=====================

A module for managing the redirecting for old urls from a previous system to new urls in SilverStripe.

Adds a tab in the CMS for adding old URLs.

The 3.1 version currently uses a hack, replacing the ModelAsController so it can change the behaviour of the error handling for 404s.

Requires SilverStripe 3.1, for 3.0 use the 3.0 branch.
